- Parameter Selection: Users can choose to keep specific URL parameters (e.g., t for Bilibili's precise airborne) via checkboxes.
- Multilingual Support: Loads based on browser language by default, supporting Simplified Chinese (zh-Hans), Traditional Chinese (zh-Hant), English (en-US), and Japanese (ja-JP).
